Responsive Portfolio

My mobile-first application . 

First, I use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. 

* I then created the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* I used Bootstrap to develop my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* I also used Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* I tried to make it so that the content should take up the entire screen, no matter how big the sizes of screens are.

* I make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on my portfolio site
